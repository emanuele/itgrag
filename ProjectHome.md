Itgrag provides elementary distortion functions for geometric graphs (structural: adding/deleting nodes/edges, geometric: displacing nodes). All functions are generic and can be composed to more complex distortions. Distortions can be applied to the whole graph or locally (based on a partitioning of the graph). Itgrag tracks all delta operations induced by the distortions, which allows for the calculation of the (local) edit distance between any two graphs generated with Itgrag.
